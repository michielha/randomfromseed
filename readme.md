This is a very simple flask application that will generate a simple 'random' colored block.

Run main.py .

Access your browser on port 5000.

See a randomly generated 'image' (HTML divs).

Access a URL /<yourrandomseed> to generate a random image with your seed.

Acessing that URL again will present you the same image, although it is not stored anywhere.
